/** Device Selection Mode.

 * This determines how an Emitter with multiple devices decides which device to emit to. It
 * currently supports the following modes:
 *
 * * **Distance**
 *
 *   This mode will select the device whose center is closest to the point being emitted.
 *
 * * **Direction**
 *
 *   This mode will select the device where the angle between the device's normal and the point's
 *   direction is the smallest.

 * * **Hybrid**
 *
 *   This mode will select the closest device. If the angle between the device's normal and the
 *   point's direction is larger than 60Â°, that device is ignored in the selection process.
